	\chapter{Basic}
	
	\section{Paragraph}
	
	This line is supposed to be a very long text. Its purpose is to show how the paragraph works in Latex. As you can see this is a multi-line text.
	
	To start a new paragraph, we can do a blank line in the latex  file. Each new paragraph has a default indent.
	
	This line is to show the effect of the indent mentioned in the previous paragraph.

	Example: Unordered List \\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The individual entries are indicated with a black dot, a so-called bullet.
		\item The text in the entries may be of any length.
	\end{itemize}

	Example: Ordered List: \\
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item This is the first entry in our list.
		\item The list numbers increase with each entry we add.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	
	
	\chapter{Images}
	Example: Use scale parameter \\

	Example: Use max width and linewidth from adjustbox package. \\
	\includegraphics[max width=\linewidth]{One_Piece_Logo.png}  
	
	Example: Use max width and textwidth from adjustbox package. \\
	\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{One_Piece_Logo.png}  
	
	Example: Use figure and reference.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{One_Piece_Logo.png}
		\caption{A nice plot.}
		\label{fig:mesh1}
	\end{figure}
